	Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You mean it controls your actions?
	Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
	You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
	but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
	There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke.
	This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
	Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

	Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression.
	The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path,
	forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
	No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive.
	A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why I can't... No, no, there is no why.
	Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

<p id="paragraph3">
	Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak.
	When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
	Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall.
	That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require.
	Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader.
	Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
